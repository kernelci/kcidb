#
# Catalog of canonical test identifiers to be used when submitting test
# results to kcidb.
#
# Find the test you are running in the catalog, and use its key as the "path"
# property when submitting the test result to kcidb.
#
# Each "test" here can be a test program or a collection thereof, but not one
# of the tests executed by such a program. You are encouraged to report the
# latter to kcidb, but they're not recorded or regulated by this catalog.
#
# When adding the test corresponding to a program, use the program's
# widely-known name, e.g. the same one you would call it at a conference. If
# the program is only known inside your company, prepend its name with the
# company name.
#
# The "title" property should describe the test briefly, and must be
# single-line. The optional "description" property could go into greater
# detail and be multi-line.
#
# The "home" property should point to the canonical, upstream location, and is
# intended for identification and as a reference to more information on the
# test, rather than a pointer to exact code being executed. The latter should
# be described within test objects submitted to kcidb instead.
#
# E.g. the Linux Test Project test suite *should* be here under the
# widely-known name "ltp". However, while its own tests, such as "chdir01" or
# "clone03" are welcome to be reported to kcidb as "ltp.chdir01" or
# "ltp.clone03", only the "ltp" test should be in this catalog. The LTP
# project's home page or its main upstream repository should be referred to in
# the "home" property, and not e.g. the specific code being executed, because
# code versions will differ between test result origins and even executions.
#
# Please keep the tests sorted alphabetically by keys.
#
# You can use the "kcidb-tests-validate" tool to check if this file is valid.
# Like this:
#
#   kcidb-tests-validate < tests.yaml
#
# If you add the -u/--urls option, it will also check if all URLs are
# reachable:
#
#   kcidb-tests-validate --urls < tests.yaml
