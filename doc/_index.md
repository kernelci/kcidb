KCIDB is a package for submitting and querying Linux Kernel CI reports, coming
from independent CI systems, and for maintaining the service behind that.

See the collected results on [our dashboard](https://kcidb.kernelci.org/).
Write to [kernelci@lists.linux.dev](mailto:kernelci@lists.linux.dev) if you want to start
submitting results from your CI system, or if you want to receive automatic
notifications of arriving results.
