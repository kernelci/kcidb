[KCIDB](https://github.com/kernelci/kcidb) is a package for submitting and
querying Linux Kernel CI reports, coming from independent CI systems, and for
maintaining the service behind that.

See the collected results on [our dashboard](https://kcidb.kernelci.org/).
Write to [kernelci@lists.linux.dev](mailto:kernelci@lists.linux.dev) if you
want to start submitting results from your CI system, or if you want to
receive automatic notifications of arriving results.

See the [Tests Catalog](https://github.com/kernelci/kcidb/blob/main/tests.yaml)
