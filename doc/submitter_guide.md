---
Here's what you need to do to submit your reports.

1. Get submission credentials and parameters.
2. Install KCIDB.
3. Generate some report data.
4. Submit report data.
5. Go to 3, if you have more.

You don't need to run a daemon, just execute command-line tools (or use the
Python 3 library, if you're feeling fancy).

1\. Get submission credentials and parameters
---------------------------------------------

Write to [kernelci@lists.linux.dev](mailto:kernelci@lists.linux.dev),
introduce yourself, and explain what you want to submit (better, show
preliminary report data). Once your request is approved, you will get a JSON
credentials file, which you can use to authenticate yourself with KCIDB
tools/library.

Export the file location (here `~/.kcidb-credentials.json`) into environment
like this:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/.kcidb-credentials.json
```

We will also need to agree on the "origin" string identifying your system
among other submitters. We'll use `submitter` in examples below.

Finally you will need to specify some or all of the following to the
tools/library:

* Google Cloud project: `kernelci-production`
* Submission queue topic: `playground_kcidb_new`
* Dataset name: `playground_kcidb_01`

The above refers to the special "playground" setup we have, where you can
freely experiment with your submissions, without worrying about any negative
effects on the system or other submitters. This setup has a [separate
dashboard](https://kcidb.kernelci.org/?var-dataset=playground_kcidb_01)
as well. We'll use playground parameters in the examples below.

Once you feel comfortable and ready, we'll add extra permissions for your
account, and you can start using the production parameters:

* Google Cloud project: `kernelci-production`
* Submission queue topic: `kcidb_new`
* Dataset name: `kcidb_01`

The submitted data will appear on our [main
dashboard](https://kcidb.kernelci.org/).

2\. Install KCIDB
-----------------


KCIDB employs continuous integration and delivery, and aims to keep
the code working at all times.

Please install the latest version from GitHub:


```bash
pip3 install --user 'git+https://git@github.com/kernelci/kcidb.git'
```

Then make sure your PATH includes the `~/.local/bin` directory, e.g. with:

    export PATH="$PATH":~/.local/bin

See [Installation](../installation) for alternatives, and if you know your
Python, feel free to do it your way!

To test your installation, authentication, and the parameters you received
execute an empty query on the database:

```console
$ kcidb-query -d bigquery:playground_kcidb_01
```

and submit an empty report:

```console
$ echo '{"version":{"major":4,"minor":1}}' |
        kcidb-submit -p kernelci-production -t playground_kcidb_new
```

Both should execute without errors, produce no output, and finish with zero
exit status.

3\. Generate some report data
-----------------------------

`kcidb-schema` tool will output the current schema version.

However, all tools will accept data complying with older schema versions. Pipe
your data into `kcidb-validate` tool to check if it will be accepted.

Here's a minimal report, containing no data:

```json
{
    "version": {
        "major": 4,
        "minor": 1
    }
}
```

You can submit such a report, it will be accepted, but will have no effect on
the database or notifications.

### Objects

The schema describes three types of objects which can be submitted
independently or in any combination:
* "checkout" - a checkout of the code being built and tested
* "build" - a build of a specific checkout
* "test" - an execution of a test on a specific build in specific environment

Each of these object types refers to the previous one using an ID. The only
required fields for each object are their IDs, IDs of the parent object
(except for checkouts), and the origin. Objects of each type are stored in
their own top-level array named respectively (in plural).

Here's an example of a report, containing only the required fields for a
checkout with one build and one test:

```json
{
    "checkouts": [
        {
            "id": "submitter:32254",
            "origin": "submitter"
        }
    ],
    "builds": [
        {
            "id": "submitter:32254",
            "checkout_id": "c9c9735c46f589b9877b7fc00c89ef1b61a31e18",
            "origin": "submitter"
        }
    ],
    "tests": [
        {
            "id": "submitter:114353810",
            "build_id": "submitter:956769",
            "origin": "submitter"
        }
    ],
    "issue": [
        {
            "id": "submitter:124853810",
            "version": 1,
            "origin": "submitter"
        }
    ],
    "incident": [
        {
            "id": "submitter:1084645810",
            "issue_id": "submitter:956769",
            "origin": "submitter",
            "issue_version": 0
        }
    ],
    "version": {
        "major": 4,
        "minor": 1
    }
}
```

If you're curious, you can query the complete objects above with this command:

    kcidb-query -d bigquery:playground_kcidb_01 -t submitter:114353810 \
                --parents

#### Object IDs

All object IDs have to start with your "origin" string, followed by the colon
`:` character, followed by your origin-local ID. The origin-local ID can be
any string, but must identify the object uniquely among all objects of the
same type you submit. E.g.:

    submitter:12
    submitter:db58a18be346
    submitter:test-394
    submitter:build-394

### Properties

Once you get the required properties (IDs and origins) generated, and have
your objects accepted by KCIDB, you can start adding the optional fields.
Some good starting candidates are described below. See the schema for more.

#### Checkouts

##### `valid`
True if the checkout is valid, i.e. if the source code was successfully
checked out. False if not, e.g. if its patches failed to apply. Set to
`True` if you successfully checked out a git commit.

Example: `true`

##### `git_repository_url`
The URL of the Git repository which contains the checked out base code.
The shortest possible `https://` URL, or, if that's not available, the
shortest possible `git://` URL.

Example: `"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git"`

##### `git_commit_hash`
The full commit hash of the checked out base code. Note that until a checkout
has the `git_commit_hash` property it may not appear in reports or on the
dashboard.

Example: `"db14560cba31b9fdf8454d097e5cb9e488c621fd"`

##### `patchset_hash`
The full hash of the patches applied on top of the commit, or an empty string,
if there were no patches. Note that until a checkout has the `patchset_hash`
property it may not appear in reports or on the dashboard.

The hash is a sha256 hash over newline-terminated sha256 hashes of each patch,
in order of application. If your patch file alphabetic order matches the
application order (which is true for patches generated with `git format-patch`
or `git send-email`), and you only have the patchset you're hashing in the
current directory, you can generate the hash with this command:

    sha256sum *.patch | cut -c-64 | sha256sum | cut -c-64

Example: `"a86ef57bf15cd35ba4da4e719e0874c8dd9432bb05d9fb5e45b716d43561d2b8"`

##### `start_time`
The time the checkout was started by the CI system. As described by [RFC3339,
5.6 Internet Date/Time Format][datetime_format].

Example: `"2020-08-14T23:08:06.967000+00:00"`

#### Builds

##### `valid`
True if the build is valid, i.e. if it succeeded. False if not.

Example: `true`

##### `architecture`
Target architecture of the build. Not standardized yet.

Example: `"x86_64"`

##### `compiler`
Name and version of the compiler used to make the build.

Example: `"gcc (GCC) 10.1.1 20200507 (Red Hat 10.1.1-1)"`

##### `start_time`
The time the build was started, according to [RFC3339, 5.6 Internet Date/Time
Format][datetime_format].

Example: `"2020-08-14T23:08:10.008000+00:00"`

#### Tests

##### `status`
The test status string, one of the following.

* `FAIL` - the test has failed, the tested code is faulty.
* `ERROR` - the test is faulty, the status of the tested code is unknown.
* `PASS` - the test has passed, the tested code is correct.
* `DONE` - the test has finished successfully, the status of the tested code
  is unknown.
* `SKIP` - the test wasn't executed, the status of the tested code is unknown.

The status names above are listed in priority order (highest to lowest), which
could be used for producing a summary status for a collection of test runs,
e.g. for all testing done on a build, based on results of executed test
suites. The summary status would be the highest priority status across all
test runs in a collection.

Example: `"FAIL"`

##### `waived`
True if the test status should be ignored.

Could be used for reporting test results without affecting the overall test
status and alerting the subscribers. For example, for collecting test
reliability statistics when the test is first introduced, or is being fixed.

Example: `false`

##### `path`
Dot-separated path to the node in the test classification tree the executed
test belongs to. The empty string signifies the root of the tree, i.e. all
tests for the build, executed by the origin CI system.

Please consult the [catalog of recognized tests][tests] for picking the
top-level name for your test, and submit a PR adding it if you don't find it.

Example: `"ltp.sem01"`

##### `start_time`
The time the test run was started, according to [RFC3339, 5.6 Internet
Date/Time Format][datetime_format].

Example: `"2020-08-14T23:41:54+00:00"`

### Extra data
If you have some data you'd like to provide developers with, but the schema
doesn't accommodate it, put it as arbitrary JSON under the `misc` field, which
is supported for every object. Then contact KCIDB developers with your
requirements.

For example, here's a `misc` field from KernelCI-native builds:

```json
{
    "build_platform" : [
        "Linux",
        "build-j7428-x86-64-gcc-8-x86-64-defconfig-wk45x",
        "4.15.0-1092-azure",
        "#102~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 14 20:28:23 UTC 2020",
        "x86_64",
        ""
    ],
    "kernel_image_size" : 9042816,
    "vmlinux_bss_size" : 1019904,
    "vmlinux_data_size" : 1595008
}
```

The kernel developers would already be able to see it in the dashboard, and
the KCIDB developers would have samples of your data which would help them
support it in the schema.

You can also put any debugging information you need into the `misc` fields.
E.g. you can add IDs of your internal objects corresponding to reported ones,
so you can track where they came from, like CKI does:

```json
{
    "beaker_recipe_id": 8687594,
    "beaker_task_id": 114353810,
    "job_id": 956777,
    "pipeline_id": 612127
}
```

4\. Submit report data
----------------------
As soon as you have your report data pass validation (e.g. with the
`kcidb-validate` tool), you should be able to submit it to the database.

If you're using shell, and e.g. have your data in file `report.json`, pipe it
to the `kcidb-submit` tool like this:

    kcidb-submit -p kernelci-production \
                 -t playground_kcidb_new < report.json

If you're using Python 3, and e.g. have variable `report` holding standard
JSON representation of your report, you can submit it like this:

```python
import kcidb

client = kcidb.Client(project_id="kernelci-production",
                      topic_name="playground_kcidb_new")
client.submit(report)
```

Your data could take up to a few minutes to reach the database, but after that
you should be able to find it in our [dashboard][dashboard], or query using
the `kcidb-query` command-line tool. For example, if you want to retrieve a
checkout object you submitted with ID `origin:23223`, execute:

    kcidb-query -d bigquery:playground_kcidb_01 -c origin:23223

If you want to retrieve all its builds and tests as well, execute:

    kcidb-query -d bigquery:playground_kcidb_01 -c origin:23223 --children

See the output of `kcidb-query --help` for usage information, including how to
retrieve builds, tests, and how to retrieve object parents.

### Submitting directly

If for any reason you cannot use the command-line tools, and you don't use
Python 3 (e.g. you are using another language in a "serverless" environment),
you can interface with KCIDB submission system directly.

NOTE: this interface is less stable than the command-line, and the library
interfaces, and is more likely to change in the future.

You will have to use one of the Google Cloud [Pub/Sub client
libraries][pub_sub_libraries] or [service APIs][pub_sub_apis] to publish your
reports to the Pub/Sub topic specified above, using the provided credentials.
Please make sure to validate each report against the schema output by
`kcidb-schema` before publishing it.

### Submitting objects multiple times

If you submit an object with the same ID more than once, then the database
will still consider them as one object, but will pick the value for each of
its properties randomly, from across all submitted objects, wherever present.

This can be used to submit object properties gradually. E.g. you can send a
test object without the `duration` and `status` properties when you start the
test. Then, when it finishes, you can send a report with a test containing the
same `id`, and only the `duration` and `status` properties, to mark its
completion.

5\. Go to 3, if you have more
------------------------------
Do not hesitate to start submitting your reports as soon as you can. This will
let you, kernel developers, and KCIDB developers see how it works, what
changes/additions might be needed to both your data and KCIDB, and improve our
reporting faster!
